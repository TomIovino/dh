The Bardic Songs of Elesidil Lightbringer Provencal

If it is true, as T. S. Eliot once said, "Bad poets immitate but great poets steal" then Elesidil Lightbringer Provencal was indeed a great poet.  For as it has sadly been discovered by this researcher, much of her poetic genius owed itself to the works of other poets, many of whom lived their lives in very distant worlds from these shores.  Nevertheless, because Elesidil's songs were often a source of intense happiness and sadness to the citizens of Konkaria, I have come to believe they are worth compiling and preserving, for the sake of tradition and historic interest.  They also reveal, I think, the great love of a mediocre poet for the gifts of those who far exceeded her own meagre talents.  I believe her desire and love of language exceeded her ability, as is sadly often the case with English Majors (hehe).
	Where I could provide the original source and occasion of the song I have done so.  But many of the songs were sung simply, as one Konkarian put it, "too often and when the spirit moved her."


"Mermaids' Song"

I have heard the mermaids singing.
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

	A favorite of Elesidil's, this song was sung on many occasions.  Original source is T. S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."


"Elfin Seduction Song"

If thou hast wisdom, hear me, Love.
Thy baths shall be the juice of July-flowers,
Spirit of roses, and of violets,
The milk of unicorns, and panthers' breath
Gathered in bags, and mixed with Cretan wines.
Our drink shall be prepared gold and amber;
Which we will take until our world whirl round
With the vertigo:  and our dwarvin servants will dance,
Our eunuch drows shall sing, our fools make up the antic,
Whilst we, in changed shapes, act Love's tales.
I will meet thee in as many shapes;
Where we may so transfuse our wandering souls
Out at our lips, and score up sums of pleasures,
O Love.


	Elesidil sang this to her first fiance, Shawn, upon the occasion of their engagement.  The original source is Ben Jonson's Volpone.


"The House de'Lethe"

In a vision once I saw
A Konkarian maid,
And on her dulcimer she played,
Singing of the House de'Lethe.

Could I revive within me
Her symphony and song,
To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
That with music loud and long,
We could build that dome in air,
That sunny dome!  with caves of ice!
And all who heard would see us there,
And all would cry, Beware!  Beware!
Their flashing eyes, their floating hair!
Weave a circle round them thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For they on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise.

	The House de'Lethe was Elesidil's conception of her perfect home.  Named after the mythological waters that evoked the poetic imagination, her gracious home of light, poetry, and song remained only a dream.  The original source of the song is Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Kubla Khan."


"Song of the Sidhe"

You meet a lady from the meads,
Full beautiful, a fairy's child;
Her hair is long, her foot is light,
And her eyes are wild.
You make a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looks at you as she does love,
And makes sweet moan.
You set her on your pacing steed,
And nothing else see all day long,
For sidelong she bends, and sings
A fairy's song.
She takes you to her elfin grot,
And there she weeps and sighs full sore,
And there you shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four.
And when she left, you sojourn there,
Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake,
And no birds sing.

	The above poem is the only song Elesidil ever sang which was subsequently requested again. (Smile)  Believing it to be a favorite, she sang it often.  Original source is John Keats's "La Bell Dame Sans Merci:  A Ballad."


"Untitled"

Forlorn!  the very word is like a bell
	To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
Adieu!  Elesidil cannot cheat so well
	As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
Adieu!  adeiu!  her plaintive song fades
	Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
		Up the hill-side;  and now 'tis buried deep
		In the next valley-glades:
Was love a vision or a waking dream?
	Fled is its music:--Do I wake or sleep?

	An intensely sad song, this poem commemorates Elesidil's feelings of loss after the death of her husband, Mingusmonk.  Its sense of sadness certainly presages her eventual suicide.  Original source is John Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale."


"untitled"

Nothing we care in our lamb white days, that time will take us.
Oh as we are young and easy in the mercy of his means,
Time holds us green and dying
Though we sing in our chains like the sea.

	Compiled because of the comment her fiance, Shawn, made to her in reference to this song.  "I wish I understood these songs you are singing, Elesidil, even half the time would be nice."  Original source is Dylan Thomas's "Fern Hill."
