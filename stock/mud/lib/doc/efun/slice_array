SYNOPSIS
	mixed *slice_array(mixed *array, int from, int to)
	string slice_array(string arr, int from, int to)

	mixed *arr[from .. to]

DESCRIPTION
	Returns an array that is a slice of the array <arr> from the
	index <from> to the index <to>. Indexes are numbered 0 to
	sizeof(arr)-1.

	The expression arr[from .. to] is equivalent to
	slice_array(arr,from,to).

	If <arr> is not an array or indexes are outside the limits of
	<arr> 0 will be returned.

	Note also that you can use the '+' und '- operators on arrays.

	slice_array() IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED! USE THE SYMBOLIC FORM
	INSTEAD!

EXAMPLES
	foo[0..1] are the first two elements / chars
	foo[0..<1] is a copy of the whole array / string except the
	last element.
	Note that the syntax for ``counting from last element'' has
	changed between versions 3.1.J and 3.1.K from ``-1'' to ``<1''.
	foo[0..-1] is now an empty string / array.

SEE ALSO
	member_array(E), sizeof(E)
