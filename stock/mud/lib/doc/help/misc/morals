Once upon a time there was an unconventional little bird who decided he wasn't
going to fly south for the winter.  So he stayed up north and after a while
he regretted his decision and decided to fly south after all.  As he was flying
the weather for colder and his little wings began to ice up.  The little
bird plummeted to the ground.  He crashed to the ground right in the middle
of a barnyard.  The little bird lay on the cold ground, freezing and shivering,
one of his little wings broken, feeling sure he was going to die.  Along 
strolled the barnyard cow and dropped a nice warm pile of manure right on
top of the little bird.  As the little bird lay there, he started to feel
a whole lot better.  Maybe, he thought, he wasn't going to die after all.
The feeling of well being began to grow in the little bird and he began to
chirp.  The barnyard cat heard the chirping and went to search for the
source.  He found the little bird in the manure, scraped the manure away
and ate the little bird. Now, this story has three morals:

1.  Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.
2.  Not everyone who digs you out of the shit is your friend...and finally
3.  If you are warm and happy in a pile of shit, keep your stupid mouth shut.
