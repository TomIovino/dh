Dear Former Player,
        Please fill out this form to the best of your ability.  After you
        are finished, please email it to nobody@localhost, where it will
        receive all the attention it deserves.  If your system is having
        nameserver problems, send it to nobody@[127.0.0.1], instead.


 The wizzes/admins at _________ are a bunch of...
        __ power-mad a**holes
        __ dictators
        __ Nazis
        __ Fascists
        ___ All of the above
        __ None of the above
        __ I don't know
        __ What's 'a**hole' mean?

 They...
        __ @toaded/@nuked/killed/banned me
        __ @booted me
        __ scolded me
        __ made faces at me

 because...
        __ I thought that they could take an infinite amount of verbal abuse.
        __ I thought it was to okay hack at their server to try to break it.
                __ Check here if you wish to use the usual, "I was just
                   testing their security for them" excuse.
        __ I love of sound of my voice, and assumed that nobody would object
           to my constant vulgar shouts.
        __ I thought that my position on the helpstaff gave me the right to
           engage in behavior that would get anyone else thrown out.
        __ I very kindly let a banned player use my character to sneak back
           into the game.
        __ I really can't tell the difference between VR and RL, and assumed
           that someone who loves me in the game must also love me in RL,
           which means that it's okay to stalk them and make death threats if
           they don't return my love.
        __ I was mad at/just broke up with...
                __ my husband/wife,
                __ my boyfriend/girlfriend,
                __ someone who trusted me,

             and used their password to log into their character and...
                __ recycle all of their belongings.
                __ obscenely redescribe all of their belongings.
                __ destroy their reputation by breaking every rule I could.
        __ I am really proud of the explicit description I wrote for my
           genitals, and I assumed that everyone would enjoy the sight of
           them in public.
        __ I know those rules and policies I agreed to when I joined the game
           are really for everyone else, not me.

 I now plan to...
        __ go from site to site, whining to everyone about how badly I
           was treated after I got caught.
        __ convince all of my friends (3 in all) to leave their site, causing
           their MU* to shut down forever.
        __ get a new character from another email address, so I can get back
           in and resume my obnoxious activities.
                __ Check here if you plan to wait a couple of months, hoping
                   they'll relax their vigilance.
        __ start a new and unique flamewar, about how unfair MU* admins are.
