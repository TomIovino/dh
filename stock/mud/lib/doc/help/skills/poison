Spell: poison
Type : wis
Mana : 40

Depending on the skill of the caster poison can be a mere nuisance,
slowing or stopping the victim's rate of healing, or could cause the
victim a slow and painful death. The effects of poison will wear off
in time, but can also be cured by casting Purify on the victim.
