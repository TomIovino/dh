Skill: Track

This skill allows a player the ability to locate foot/paw prints in 
the ground regardless of terrain. Depending on the race that is using
it, track could involve smelling the air, tasting the ground, magical
residue, a sixth sense or some other racially devoloped ability. 
Regardless of this, the gods have seen fit to give everyone some sort
of innate sense that can be devoloped with similiar affects.

Tracks over time will become blurry and give less details.
