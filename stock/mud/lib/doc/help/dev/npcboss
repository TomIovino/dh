Level 100 and greater npcs are special, the gear that they hold are
considered to be relics and it is important that they are balanced
well with other npcs and items. This level npc is to limited to
once per reboot and one npc per area. These npcs often end up being
Dragons, Demons and other fantastic creatures. It is at level 100
npcs may be given a +1/+3 bonus to any one item based any extra 
specials, or extra problems the player has in defeating that npc.
