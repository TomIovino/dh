This is how you calculate the MINIMUM weight for objects.

WC + AC * 0.5 = MINIMUM
WC + AC * 1.0 = AVERAGE 
WC + AC * 1.5 = MAXIMUM

Realize that with a 100 strength you can carry 500 units of weight.

See help file on encumberance.

You must have a strength > weight * 3 to wear/wield.

Round up on all items.
