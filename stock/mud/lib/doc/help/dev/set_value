Most of the value on NPC's should come from the items they carry,
not the coins. With this in mind the max amount of COINS a npc
can carry is level * level. In other words a level 1 NPC can
have 1 copper and a level 100 NPC can have 10000 copper, actual
coins should be roughly half of the maximum allowed.

Actual value should be roughly half of the maximum value, unless it
makes sense for the item to be of higher than normal value (made of
precious metals, encrusted with jewels, or just really cool, as in
"magical"). Naturally, an item described as tarnished, rusty, old,
and the like should be of even lower value. 

Note: Items with gems and such are usually heavier =)


This is how you calculate the value of items:
    (WC + AC + BONUSES * WC + AC + BONUSES) * 10  = VALUE 
example:
     25 +  0 +    5    * 25 + 0  +    5     * 10  = 9000 (maximum value)
     25 +  0 +    5    * 25 + 0  +    5     * 10  = 4500 (average value)
