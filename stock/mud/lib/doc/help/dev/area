This help file describes QC rules for zones (or areas).

Area Theme:
 - Areas must have a medieval fantasy theme. There will be NO exceptions
   to this rule. This not only means area concept, but also all references
   to modern foods, items, ideas, drinks, etc. will not be acceptible.
 - No "Heaven" or "Hell" areas will be accepted.
 - The above is a specific of the more general rule: No areas taken from
   history, fiction, mythology or legend will be accepted.
 - No towns. (One shop etc dosnt quantify a town)

Area Format:
 - ALL area directories  must be in the wizards primary directoy. (/w/ash)
 - ALL files for an area must be located in that area subdirectoy.

Area Size:
 - Areas must have a minimum of 15 rooms to be accepted.
 - Areas in excess of 50 rooms will not be approved unless you can
   convince Ash that such a thing is needed, and so far it has not
   happened.

Area NPCs:
 - Only ONE NPC OVER LEVEL 90 is allowed per area.
 - Only ONE "fantastic" creature will be allowed per area. Fantastic
   creatures include: dragons, lichs, combinations of the first two,
   vampires, devils, demons from the Abyss, angels from Heaven, and so
   on. If you have any doubt about NPCs you have planned, be sure to
   ask QC before you begin work on it.
 - No NPC may have more than 3 items. 
 - NPCs must NOT have names from fiction or history, including legends and
   mythology.
 - NPC/room ratio: roughly 1 NPC for every 2 rooms.
