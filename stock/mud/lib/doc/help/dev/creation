   The first area an apprentice will complete is known as
   'firstarea' which has a special document for it located
   at /doc/help/dev/firstarea.

   To begin work on a new area you need a proposal. 
   This should include, size, theme, and include details
   for what you are wishing to create. This should be mailed
   to Ash for feedback on what if anything needs to be changed.

   When you area is completed mail Ash again. I will assign someone
   who has time to QC your area and mail you feedback on what
   needs to be fixed or changed. 

   Note on mailing ash.. use email, mudmail or whatever, but if you
   dont get feedback try mailing him again using another method.
