FUNCTION set_name() in base_obj (players,npcs,weapons,armour)

Please make sure the following things are true for
the set_name function on objects and npcs:

In general all set_name's should be only a single word.
   good = set_name("bob");
   bad = set_name("bob marley");

Also make sure set_name is always _lowercase_!!

!NEVER USE ANSI IN SET_NAME!

Also in both items and monsters set_name should  be as descriptive as
possible. The more specific you the name the better:

All level 80+ items, npcs, gear.. 
   need to have UNIQUE set_name 's 

In otherwords 
   good = set_name("bladestar") 
   bad = set_name("blade");
   good = set_name("cinder");
   bad = set_name("dragon");

Thanks! 
  Ash
