varargs void set_wander(int chance, int time, string *dirs, mixed limit);

All arguments are optional.


Examples:

    o Disable Wandering
        set_wander();
        set_wander(0);

    o Basic Random wandering, with 'chance' percent every heart_beat
        set_wander(chance);
            e.g.  set_wander(10)     10% chance of wandering
          
    o Random wandering attempt every 'time' heart_beats, with 'chance'
      percent each attempt:
        set_wander(chance,time);
            e.g.  set_wander(50,5)   50% chance of moving every five
              heart_beats

    o Wandering attempt every 'time' heart_beats, with 'chance' percent each
      attempt walking a set path 'path':
        set_wander(chance,time,path);
            e.g.  set_wander(50,5,({ "n", "e", "s", "w" })) 
                50% chance of moving every 5 heart_beats with the first
                move being 'north', second 'east', third 'south', and
                lastly 'west'. The function patrol_end() is called in
                the monster (so you can change the patrol randomly maybe
                (with a new set_wander()). If not changed, the path just
                resets and repeats.

    o Random wandering attempt every 'time' heart_beats, with 'chance' percent
      each time, no set path, but limit wandering mob to your area:
        set_wander(chance,time,0,1);
            e.g.  set_wander(50,5,0,1)
