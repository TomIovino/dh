Balance Modifiers for Equipment Npcs.

First step is to figure out the wc and weight and length of an item,
then modify them accordingly according to the following standards.

Every 2 units of weight below average -1 (maximum -3)
Every 5" below average (35") length -1 (maximum -3)
Every 2 units above normal weight +1 (maximum +3)
Every 5" above average (35") length +1 (maximum +3)
Items with ego get a bonus:  * ego 100 = +1, 125 = +2, 150 = +3.
Npcs over level 100 recieve a +1/20 levels.
