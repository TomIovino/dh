PART: 1 (QC)

This document describes some of the quality control expectations. 
Note: monsters, npcs, and mobs are all the same thing. =)

Short descriptions: (set_short)
           a. always use lowercase.
           b. refrain from using "a" or "an" to start a description.
           c. always include atleast one adjective.           
           d. do not use proper names in the short descriptions
           d. Example: set_short("tall elven sentry");

Long descriptions: (set_long)
           a. Proper capitalization and punctation required, for muds
              this means only 1 space after periods.
           b. the shortest long description should be 2 FULL lines.
              the average long description for an area will be 3 or
              more lines, please dont make descriptions longer then
              6 lines unless it is extremly special.
           e. avoid ALL use of third person speech when creating a
              npc/monster description.
           f. AVOID 'A rAdiCal oRC', etc.
