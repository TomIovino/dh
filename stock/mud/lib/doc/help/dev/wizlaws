WIZRULES.ASH.4.4.98

These are the rules:
--------------------

1.  The rules are not limited to those written, wizards are bound
    by the spirit of common sense and required to use good judgement.
    Not all situations can be govered in a simple document, being
    a wizard requires responsibilty something which you must prove
    you have consistantly or lose your wizard status.

2.  Wizards may be removed for inactivity or demoted to the position 
    of retired builder. However, I trully do understand that real life 
    is important and will not remove people who are, "taking breaks" from
    the mud, only those who are nolonger in my opinion "gone". Wizards
    demoted will be made mortals of the same name. 
    
3. No mortal interferance. (Primary Directive =)
    a) no helping mortals
    b) no hindering mortals 
    c) if you have mortal you MUST wait 15 minutes to switch 
       from wiz-mortal OR mortal-wiz.

4. Abusive code is not allowed. 
    a) coding any powers not given at your wiz level is abusive code.
    b) coding that alters players in any way with out player and
       admin permission is abusive code.

5. Ash founded Dragonheart and operates it. 
   a) For a list of additional code credits see /doc/help/credits.
   b) The Dragonheart Mudlib is protected legally by its creators.
   c) Wizard created areas will be removed at the request of the creator.
