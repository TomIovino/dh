FIRSTAREA.ASH.5.12.97

A wizards FIRSTAREA is the requirement between the Immortal ranks of
GHOST and SPIRIT. This gives us a glance of your work. Here are the 
guidelines for a FIRSTAREA.

The area is to be descriptions of forest type rooms.
ALL code must be in /w/yourname/forest/~
This area can be shaped 4x4, 4x5, 3x5, or whatever you want.

A README file should list all important characteristics of your area.

15-20 rooms (max)
5-10 npc's (max)
levels 1-20 (max)

This is in every way possible a test.



Lot of new creators are tempted to want to make there firstarea part
of some grand realm they would like to create or add a large amount
of special code and or effects/quests. I want these first areas to
be stand alone zones. Consider it part of the plan. =)
