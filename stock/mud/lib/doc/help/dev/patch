command: patch 
wiz level: 30

Patch is a command that essentially acts as a gopher between YOU and
the OBJECT you would like to INTERFACE. Patch calls FUNCTIONS in the
object with something called CALL_OTHER.

All the "patch" function needs is an OBJECT and a FUNCTION but also 
sometimes uses an ARGUMENT.

Example: patch me::set_title::the NEW WIZ!

ESSENTIALLY that means CALL_OTHER, OBJECT, FUNCTION, ARGUMENT! =)

note: always patch set_house, set_spouse, set_race lowercase!!!!
note: yes this is logged, and abuse means torture. -Ash =)
