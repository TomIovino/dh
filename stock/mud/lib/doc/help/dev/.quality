QUALITY-ASH-5.12.97

This document describes some of the quality control expectations. 
(additional information located in /doc/mudlib/description)

General - code should be written neatly. 

Make sure to include the mud.lib and the proper inherits for every item.
	ie: #include <mudlib.h>
	inherit ROOM;
	etc
	
Use the add_object function for adding npcs, weapons, etc.

Don't use any ascii art in your areas such as stuff like 
'YoU FaLl DoWn A bIg HoLe', etc. 

Also, when doing your longs, use only one space after periods and
commas. And, when doing objects refrain from using capital letters on 
each word unless it is _absolutely_ necessary. 
 - In general room desc ...
    * The desc should include at least 3 lines of text. 
    * Usage of "makes you feel strange" and other such blunt feelings
      should be used VERY rarely. Instead use the text to convey feeling.
      ie - (calmness) The grass sways gently below your feet ...
           (fear) The rocks wobble upon the ledge above, threatening to
                  fall at any moment ...
A lot of wizards are using 3rd person speech when creating room longs. 
This is a very poor way to create rooms descriptions. Everyone is guilty 
of this error, so we shall have to work on this together. From now the 
word 'you' should not be used in more then 1:10 rooms. Other 'bad' word
are feel, think and sense. (etc).

Every important noun and action listed in the room description needs  
to be defined in some way. Atleast 50% of the nouns in your room 
must be described, also set_listen and set_smell should be in every room.

Things you should have in every description:
	sky or ceiling#u#up -> This should be for looking at whatever is 
	overhead
	ground or floor#d#down -> This is for whatever is the below the 
        player's feet
      
    * Room must fit the area. 
      ie - No trees in desert. No shop under rocks.
    * For short descriptions finish sentence : "You are in..."
      ie : a swamp : a cave : a river
    * As for exits use north, ne, east, se, south, sw, west, nw, down or up.
    * No death traps. Please, no cliffs to fall off or pits to fall into
      unless there is a VERY good reason to.
      - cliffs and pits should use climb stat, perhaps some falling damage.
        climbing/falling can be set for up/down movements.
    * Traps, should be able to be detected, and disarmed by thieves.
      - there is generic trap code for doors, and chests.
    * Remember to use the set_smell and set_listens in all your rooms.
