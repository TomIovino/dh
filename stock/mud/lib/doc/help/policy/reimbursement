           Dragonheart policy on Reimbursements:
                === NO REIMBURSEMENTS! ===
                  Ash,  'October 31, 1995'
Why?
A policy of reimbursement creates an environment where bugs
and where cheating can easily festor. Although the game is
designed so that gear will save on players, it is possible
that one day you might lose your gear. Little can be done
about this in a fair manner that avoids the possible for 
false claims, so it the policy that no reimbursements are
given.
