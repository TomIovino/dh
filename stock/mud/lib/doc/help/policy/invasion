  It is possible to invade another house's castle by killing their gate
  guards. The following rules apply to such an invasion:

    1. Don't linger...kill what you're going to kill and get out.

    2. Don't set gates or teleport destinations in another house's
       castle.

    3. Don't log off from another house's castle.
