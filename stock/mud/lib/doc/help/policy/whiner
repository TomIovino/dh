Often people want to know exactly what a 'whiner' is and why a person
may be justifiably referred to as one. Please check the following list:

 - Player wants things to be easier rather than better.
 - Player complains of not doing well when not really trying to do better.
 - Player does not want to be challenged (this has several subcategories)
      a) Player wants getting the best eq to be easier.
      b) Player wants to be virtually immune to enemy attacks.
      c) Player wants enemies to die via looking meanly at said enemies.

Basically, everyone complains, the world is not perfect, and no two people
agree on everything the same. However, there are some people who work with
what they are given, and there are some people who cry about them and feel
sorry for themselves. It is the latter that we call "whiners."
