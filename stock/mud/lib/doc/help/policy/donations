Im a firm believer that muds should be free and that muds are cool because 
they are free, however someone, some where is always paying for the link.
Right now that someone is me, if you want help keep my costs to a minimum,
and can afford it, then You might consider sending in some money to help 
keep us up and running. All donors of 25$ or more will recieve special
benifits: 1 hp AND 1 sp per $2 donated plus the following additional gifts
for players, unique equipment permanently granted to your player!

25$  Gift = 1 unique "pocket" (wt10, capacity 100)
50$  Gift = 1 unique "armour" (wt10,ac14,+1+1 shield/body=ac26,wt20,+1+1)
100$ Gift = 1 unique "weapon" (wt20,wc27,ln30,+1+1,special attk)

IE, for $150, You get 75+ HP/SP, and can get a unique weapon and unique
armour, which will be created for you based on your input and wants..
