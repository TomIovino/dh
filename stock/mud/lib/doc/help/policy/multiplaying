  Multiplaying is prohibited on DragonHeart. Each player is allowed to
  have only ONE character. If you wish to start a new character, you
  must first contact an admin about having your old character deleted.

  If you have had multiple characters here previously, decide which one
  you will be playing, and mudmail Ash or Leela with a list of the others
  to be deleted.

  Violations of this rule will be enforced in accordance with 'help zap'.
