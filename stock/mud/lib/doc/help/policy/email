Type 'email' for your current email address.

It's important to have valid email so the administation can determine
legitimate players from those whom are not. Valid email is a good sign
that players are legit. Also, should you ever lose your password and need
a new one, it can only be sent to the email listed in your file which
you can read by typing 'email'. Also should we ever need to contact
players on other matters (such as site change) our best way to do
so is with your email address.

1. Violations of this policy are dealt with under 'help zap'.
2. Free email accounts are considered invalid emails by this Mud.
3. AOL users who connect from AOL must have a VALID AOL email or 
   will be deleted as soon as I see them. 

If you need to change your email talk to any Administrator. Example:
tell ash hi my new email address is joe@new.site.com.
