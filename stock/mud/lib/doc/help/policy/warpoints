 Players can earn warpoints in player killing.

 1. All PK level players will always have at least one "warpoint".
 2. Players who are not PK have [*] warpoints. (ie 0)
 3. If you kill a player with more than or equal warpoints, 
    you gain a point.
 4. If you die to a pk you lose a point.
 5. If you kill a player with very few points compared to yourself,
    you have a chance to lose a point yourself. 'help pk'
 6. Higher warpoints add to OPB, SPB, DPB, CPB.
