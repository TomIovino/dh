  YES, PLAYER KILLING IS RESTRICTED.
  When your 'alt level' reaches 50 you are assigned a warpoint
  causing the [*] by your name to be replaced by a [1]. The [1] 
  signifies 'wp' status. Anyone with a 'wp' is may be killed by
  legally by other players with 'wp' status.

  Generally its expected that players will hunt within + or -3 
  warpoints of themselves. People who hunt below -3 wp's of their 
  own 'wp' status often are considered grief players. Grief players
  may be fined warpoints for excessive 'grief killing'.

  All PKs are logged by the 'deaths' command. Illegal pks have a 
  * notation on the logs. Illegal PKs and grief playing will be
  investigated by the adminisation.
