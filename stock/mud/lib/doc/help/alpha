    Mission Statement: Project Alpha

        As of Dragonheart's sixth aniversary the world has preety 
        much gone unchanged for quite in what is availible to players 
        in terms of features and areas, with a few exceptions. The 
        primary reason for this is because "Dragonheart" is a 
        "complete package". While Im quite proud of this world it 
        has its downside. Dragonheart is built on code dating back 
        to 1987. Since then many people altered updated and changed 
        that code. But its still a 1987 model. When I first started
        Dragonheart I had little coding experience and was working
        with very inefficient (but feature packed) base world. With
        the advancement of my own skills Dragonheart too has advanced
        but at this point I cannot make this world what my skills and
        ambition desire.. to do so requires completely new code.

        Project Alpha is a new project which will replace the dev
        mud on port 8000. The aim of this undertaking is to first
        remove essentially ever concievable piece of code on the game 
        and rebuild it using more efficient, more advanced, more sane
        coding practices. This ambitious undertaking is not something
        that will be done overnight, in fact, Im giving myself a year
        to create the basic library. The ultimate goal is to eventually
        replace Dragonheart with a new world.. but not overnight and
        not rushed or half coded.. Leela will continue to admistrate
        Dragonheart (8888) while I begin to develope (8000) I would 
        say that Dragonheart has no less then a year of existance and 
        no more then two years. Player files and donors will be 
        coverted to some degree- Ill do what I can. Enjoy this world 
        and have fun =) ~Ash  (nov 2001)
