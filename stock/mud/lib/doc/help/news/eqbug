  Sunday Night I unknowly introduced a logon bug while updating the
  some global command code. This was an accident and I regret that
  it happened. Anyone who was effected by this I apologize too.

  I have no viable options to replace the gear that players lost
  due to my error, again Im sorry. I am introducing some code from
  alpha on live site and obviously I ran into a conflict.

  I assure you that I attempt to make safe changes for the mud, 99%
  of all updates over the last 7 years have resulted in no problems
  and had I known this code could have caused any problems I would
  have done a backup as I have done in the past before updating the
  mud. 

  Many players are upset that they lost gear, but its important to
  realize that things like this -can- happen. Try to deal with it
  if you can. If you cant again, Im sorry.  Ash
