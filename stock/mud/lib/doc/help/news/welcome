               Dragonheart is closed until further notice. 
               -------------------------------------------
The reason behind this action is quite simple. Over the last six years
I have attempted to create a 'perfectly fair, creative world' for players
to enjoy and have fun on while myself remaining an objective, fair, 
non-judgemental administator. I have in this attempt failed. Instead for
the last six years, I have played babysitter to misbehaved children. I
wish that this percentage of players was realitively small, after looking
closely I find that Ive dealt with a large portion of the players, and
of those players often I have to deal with the same individuals who I see
repeated a circle of abuse. I simply have no longer an interest in 
running Dragonheart at this time and its current form. Someday I "may" do
something "new" but dont bother mailing me about Dragonheart. 

Sincerly, The Divine Entity Formerly Known As, ~Ash
Peace.
