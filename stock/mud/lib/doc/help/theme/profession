    Professions are chosen from your whatever class you are:
        Class    = [ Warrior, Magician, Cleric, Rogue ]
    Then you must either select a profession based on the
        Elements = [ Fire, Water, Earth, Air ]
        Faith    = [ Chaos, Order, Life, Death ]
 
    Pick a profession from 'help professions' that is 
        YOUR [Class AND Element] OR YOUR [Class AND Faith]

    Note: element and faith is derived from your race! 'help races'

    In this unique and brilliant fashion professions are archieved
    in a balanced fashion creating a mix of valid archtype professions
    based on hybrid of race, class, element and faith. Oh yah, this
    whole concept does nothing on this mud at the moment, except 
    change your score command. :) You may repick as much as ya like.
   
    See 'help professions' ---> Command: profession <profession>
