Its now very simple to get married or divorced for that matter.

Type: To get married type marry <who> and then if <who> 
      also types marry <you> then you will be married. Very simple.

      *note to divorce someone just type 'divorce <who>. 

It is highly recommended that you consider roleplaying an event
such as marriage, most players consider it a good time and will
often offer gifts or blessings.
