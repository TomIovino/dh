command: quests

Quests have almost no rules here but it does fall under the 
help documents 'help magic' and 'help information'. Meaning
basically the more people that know the less the reward a
quest will have for solving it. Most quests use the following
basic commands to give hints: search, look at <>, smell, listen.

The reason for our policy is because we really cannot stop
players from sharing quest info offline, or even online. The
fact of the matter is however, the more people that know how
to do a quest, the less the rewards for that quest will be.
