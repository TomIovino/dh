  Feelings are emotes that are already written for you.  That is, to smile
  you need only type 'smile'.  You can get the current list of what is
  available by typing 'feelings'.  There are four different types of
  feelings:
      * standard -- This is when you type just the feeling by itself
                    like:  'smile', 'laugh', 'ack', etc.  Usually that
                    will say:  'So-and-so smiles.', 'So-and-so laughs.',
                    etc.
 
      * targeted (also called directed) -- This is when you type the feeling
                    followed by the name of who you are directing the action
                    at, such as:  'smile billy', 'kick billy', etc.  That
                    will usually say:  'So-and-so smiles at Billy', 
                    'So-and-so kicks Billy', etc.
 
      * modified -- This is when you type the feeling followed by something
                    extra that isn't a living target such as:  'smile blah',
                    'kick the bucket', 'offer apple', etc.  Most of the time
                    they will say something like:  'So-and-so smiles blah', 
                    'So-and-so kicks the bucket', etc.
 
      * self-directed -- This is the same as targeted above except it's when
                    you specify yourself as the argument such as:
                    'smile so-and-so'
 
  'whocoded <feeling>' can be used to show who wrote a certain emote.
