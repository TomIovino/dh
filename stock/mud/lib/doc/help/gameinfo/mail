  DH's internal mail system can be accessed from anywhere on the mud and
  does not require the presence of a post office.

  To read mail, simply type 'mail' to enter the program. Then type the
  number of the message you wish to read. You can mark a message for
  deletion by typing 'd', and 'q' quits the program. For further command
  options, type 'h' (help).

  To send mail to another player, type 'mail <playername>'. The form is
  self-explanatory from there.
