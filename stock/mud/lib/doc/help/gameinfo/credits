   The Dragonheart Mudlib was built with few exceptions by Daniel
   "Ash" Huber, the administator. This mud like all muds could not
   have been, had it not been for the people who took the step before
   them to create the next level of code. This is my step, and I can
   confidently say its a rather big one, so enjoy yourself here.

   Dragonheart would like to thank Lars Penji for the basic and original
   LP MUD engine, Bubbs for mailer and command protocals, and Geewhiz
   for our rankings and partying domains.

   Dragonheart areas are created by individual players who wanted 
   to help build this world. All Dragonheart areas are unique. All
   areas are created on another mud just for the builders.
