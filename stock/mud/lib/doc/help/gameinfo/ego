  There are some weapons, armours and other items in the game that are
  incredibly powerful, enough so that they are considered 'relics'.
  All of these relics have a defined 'ego'.

  An ego of a relic is determined by its maker, however a 
  character's 'ego' is determined by their level + primal. If 
  you wish to get, keep, use, wear, wield a relic you must 
  have a higher ego than the relic in question.   

  Items with ego cannot be properly held or saved with those of lower
  ego than the item. If you should happen to have one it is possible
  that the item will simply vanish..
