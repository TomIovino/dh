      Anyone may attempt magic. The success of this relies on the 
      following: First of all, a spell requires a certain amount of
      'spell points' which is listed in the help files for each spell.
      Secondly each spell requires either intellect or wisdom, the 
      higher the mana cost of a spell the more difficult the casting,
      therefore only those with high intellect and wisdom can effectively
      cast the spells which require high amounts of spell points. 
      Thirdly with repeated attempts at a spell a caster will gain skill
      in the magic making repeated castings much easier.
