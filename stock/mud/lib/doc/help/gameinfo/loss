Sometimes players lose gear.  There are several reasons why
this may happen:
          1.  You may have done something without realizing it.
          2.  You may have lost the gear without realizing it.
          3.  It may have been stolen without your knowledge.
          4.  A wizard may have removed it for a particular reason.
          5.  A system error may cause item loss.
           
Dealing with loss is a roleplaying experience.  Accept it.
