Welcome to DragonHeart

If you haven't been active in a while or are new to the game it's highly
suggested that you read the help files. On this mud, almost everything
has been documented for players that they need to know.  Often we get
questions like, "what is X?", when QUITE often "X" is a help file that
is available to all mortals. In fact I get a question pretty much every
day that is answered in the help files. It would help us out a lot of 
mortals would type "help X" before asking what is "X" to a staff member.
Secondly, when you cannot find information in the help files, that means
you have typed "help X" and found that no information is present, then
your next move is to type "who" and look for  a "(NH)". These people are
graciously willing to answer a couple questions about the game, if all
else fails, ask on channels, or ask someone you know who is a player.
While we are on the subject, I've been asked well over a thousand times
"Do you have time to answer a question?". Please, please... don't bother
with the small talk, I can vouch for all of the staff members when I say,
just ASK the question, We are most likely busy and this sort of thing
turns into frustration, so just ask and either we will answer or we 
won't. I'm more likely to reply if you just ask the question upfront.
Lastly, if you type 'help' and don't know each and every topic at least
to a degree you a) dont know our rules and might end up getting yourself
trouble (ignorance is no excuse when the rules are and policies are clearly
stated in our help files) and b) dont know the game and are prolly making 
things harder on yourself because of it.  (example would be is if you dont
know about 'lore' ) I hope everyone takes these suggestions very seriously
before it ruins either your or my day.
