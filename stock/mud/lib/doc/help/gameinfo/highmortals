Highmortals:

  Highmortals are selected not by level, but past actions which 
  over years and years, have proven them responsible players, 
  capable of following the rules of the Administration. They 
  are in every way normal mortals, with every responsibility
  and hindrance that every other mortal has. However in addition
  they have extra responsibilities which give them the powers
  of "first response" in an emergency situation in which no 
  Admin is present. These powers are logged by the Administration
  so that everything is on the up-and-up. Should you have a question
  about the Highmortal policy/program please mail Ash.
