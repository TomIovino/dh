Flee: This command will allow you to make an attempt to escape combat in
a completely random direction.

Perhaps a more intelligent means to flee from combat is to simply attempt
to leave the room in the direction of your choosing. Should you be blocked,
you need only keep trying, and eventually you will evade your attacker and
get out of the room.
