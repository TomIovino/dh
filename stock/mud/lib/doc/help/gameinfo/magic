Magic is something which is unique and powerful. DragonHeart is filled
with various forms of magic. The magic I wish to discuss here is not
monsters or spells, these topics are covered in other help files later. 
This file is to generally explain the concept of magic itself, which
by definition is 'rare' and 'unique'. When everyone has a 'rare' item
or weapon, it becomes part of the 'norm' and is no longer considered magic.
An example of this would be a piece of "divine" armour. If everyone has
"divine" armour, it really has become "average" because it is the norm.

Hopefully you understand what Im saying here..
