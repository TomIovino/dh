  Command: train <skill|spell>

  This will let you train a skill/spell upto your skill/spell
  level of 90% of current player level.

  Trains get significantly more expensive with increased skill.

  Note: This command does not prevent you from raising your
  skill above what would be allowed by notching. Players
  are responsible for managing until further notice.
