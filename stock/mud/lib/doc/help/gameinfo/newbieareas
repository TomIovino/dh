  Areas with small npcs that are suitable for low level players are
  clustered around the city of Twilite. Room exits marked 'trail' lead
  to these areas. One large newbie area is located directly north of
  town: go out the north gates, then 2 north, then 'cavern'. Please
  note that the 'return' spell doesn't work inside this area, so don't
  get lost.
