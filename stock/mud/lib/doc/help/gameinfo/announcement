Welcome back to DragonHeart. It is important that you read the following
before beginning to play.

  - Multiple characters are no longer allowed here. See 'help multiplaying'
    and reacquaint yourself with 'help rules'.

  - The spell list has been changed. Be sure to read 'help spell list'
    before praying stats.

  - Read 'help pk' and 'help theme'. We expect nobles to concentrate on
    killing each other, rather than lower level players.

  - If you are a new player, read 'help newbie'.

  - Npcs are still being updated and tweaked, so they may change a bit
    from one day to the next.

  - Several old areas have been brought back, but may not be exactly as
    you remember them.
