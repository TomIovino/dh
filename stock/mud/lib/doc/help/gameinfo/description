Player Description ----- Syntax : describe 

This command allows you to describe yourself to other users
who look at you in a room. Commands are listed when you
type describe. If you decide you don't like your description
you may type 'clear' at the normal prompt.

Some example descriptions:

Bad: You tremble in fear at his mighty stature.

This is bad because you're assuming the person looking at you can't
kick your... butt. Which may in fact not be true. For example, if an
immortal was the one looking at you, his/her reaction would most
likely be "I think not."

Bad: He is much taller than you.

This is bad because you're assuming things once again, I need not
explain why it should be obvious.

Bad: She is a member of the Clan Kordine and a cunning warrior.

This is bad because unless there is some reason that the looker would
know your clan affiliation just by looking at you, they wouldn't. Also
no one can tell how good a warrior you are unless they see you in
battle (and if the person looking at you is kicking your butt, the
description will be amusingly untrue).

Good: He is tall with broad shoulders, his dark eyes look warily about,
      noticing everything. On his cloak he bears the colours and
      heraldry of House Kordine, and his armour bears the marks of
      many a hard fought battle.

This is good because it makes no assumptions about how the person
looking feels looking at him. The words speak for themselves, and
the person looking decides what it means for him/herself.

In other words, the best description is one that gets across the ideas
you want to say without making any assumptions about who is looking at
you. Be it a god or a newbie who is looking at you, your description
will always ring true.

Using the describe command for anything other than a description of
your player will cost at least one level if seen by an admin.
