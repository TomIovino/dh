Healing: Healing on DragonHeart involves a lot of waiting; however, this
process can be accelerated through a variety of means. Most effective of
all is using healing magic to heal physical damage.

Aside from that, eating and drinking will also immediately restore some
amount of lost hit points. More importantly though, as long as you are
not hungry or thirsty, both hit points and mana will regenerate more
quickly. Making sure you are never hungry or thirsty is thus the most
essential key to regenerating as quickly as possible.
