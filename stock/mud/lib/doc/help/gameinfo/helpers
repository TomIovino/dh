Helpers are listed on 'who' by the [NH] statement shown.

Players who have this toggled are usually available to answer
questions about the rules and possibly give hints. Helpers
may or may not help you level or give you gear depending
on the individual. All helpers are volunteer players, they
dont -have- to do anything. Experienced players may set their
[NH] 'flag' with the command 'helper'.

Remember, newbie helpers put the NH in dragoNHeart!
