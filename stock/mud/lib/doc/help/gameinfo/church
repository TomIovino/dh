The church serves a very important function in the world.  It is in the
church that you pray to the Gods for increased power.  As a newbie you will
be able to pray for 4 stats at level 1.  Once you have levelled you will 
be able to pray for increased stats at the rate of 4 stats per level. 
When you are in a church simply type 'pray' to find out how this is done.

The 'return' spell will bring you back to church, and you will also be sent
there when you die.

There is a donation chest in the church where you can obtain some
basic equipment to get you started. Message boards are also located in
the church.
