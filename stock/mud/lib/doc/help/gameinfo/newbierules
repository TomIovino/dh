  Newbies have some special policies connected with them. We frown
  on spam killing anyone, but especially newbies. Please read the
  'help pk' file for details on that.

  Newbies are also warned at this point, yet again, if you do not
  have a proper name, or disobey primary rules, you will be deleted.
  The rules are simple and well documented ('help rules'). Please
  make sure you follow them.
