'Equipment' in this world is a reference that describes 'armour' and
'weapons' that players use to adventure. Armour is 'worn' and weapons
are 'wielded' in hands. Players may see all items they are using with
the 'equipment' command. All gear not worn or wielded that you are
carrying can be seen with the 'inventory' command.

Players may use the 'lore' command to get a general idea of how good
an item rates. Eventually you may use the 'identify' spell to get exact
specifications on gear.

Because adventuring is dangerous work not only for the adventurer but
for the equipment being used, items have a chance of being damaged. 
Normally this type of damage consists of 'scratches' and 'nicks' and
requires no repair. It is however quite possible for items to take 
damage and break making the item useless forever.
