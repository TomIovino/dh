  Dragonheart is very unique in the manner in which overt power
  is gained. Players may advance in power in many many different
  ways. The first and most basic of these being to advance in 
  levels, which will automatically go up as you gain experience.
  Each time your level increases, you are given "prayers" which
  are used to increase your primary stats, such as stamina, 
  dexterity, agility, strength, intellect, wisdom, focus, 
  and primal. These eight stats may also be altered by gear
  and spells. Stats are very important, because they are the 
  controlling force of your player.
