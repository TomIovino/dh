Movement is a player's ability to move from one location
to another. Players have 'movement points' based on 
dexterity. Movement points, or just "MP" are required to
do certain tasks. Normal actions require almost no effort
and have very little movement costs. Some combat
actions or skills or other exhausting tasks will require
more movement points. Exhausted players will be unable to
move which can be dangerous.
