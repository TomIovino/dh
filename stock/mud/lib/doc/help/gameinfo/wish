:::WISH:::
At level 100 a player may sacrifice 100 million experience and
10 thousand gold to summon the power of a wish. In so doing the
player will raise one stat/maxstat by one point permanently. 

syntax: wish <stat>

:::WISH REMORT:::
A second option at level 100 is a wish remort. At the time the
player wishes for a remort, they are set to level 1, have no skills,
minimum stats and no experience. However they gain the advantage
of having a maximum permanent +10 stat/maxstat.

syntax: wish remort <stat>

Players can wish any stat up to +10 using either method.
