The Council of Founders consists of those people from whom Dragonheart has
received some assistance in the past that has helped us along the way.
This list has grown rather large over the years and currently consists
of many people who have made contributions financially which have under-
written the costs of running the site, or people who have built or coded
or provided other assistance to the mud's operation.

Founders are identified in 'playerinfo'.
