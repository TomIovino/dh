    BTI = 'bug', 'typo' and 'idea'

    These 3 commands are available to players for reporting errors and
    making suggestions. Simply type the appropriate word followed by
    your report, for example:

        typo in the room desc, cieling should be ceiling

        bug I can't read the sign in this room

        idea Neutrals should have their own private board

    All reports are logged from the room in which they are filed, so for
    specific room/mob errors, please make your report from the room in
    which the error occurs.
