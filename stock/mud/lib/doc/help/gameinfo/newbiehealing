   Healing can be dramatically increased a number of ways. 
   Eating, drinking water, and alcohol all have a positive affect
   on your regeneration of health, movement, and spell points.
   Sleeping, and resting are very good for regeneration. Finding 
   someone who has created a rune of health is also of great 
   benefit in regeneration. Spells like heal, refresh, prayer and
   invigor also aid in gaining health once you have the proper
   training.
