  Death happens when you reach 0 hit points, at which time you are
  sent to your church. When you die you have 1% lost in all skills 
  and spells and 1 level is lost. All items that you had on you 
  when you died will remain with your corpse, and will probably be
  looted if you were killed by another player.

  It is IMPOSSIBLE to have less total stats then anyone with the same
  number of levels and wishes at your level, because of the way the
  mud has been coded to reconfigure total stats every log in.
