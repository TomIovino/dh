]non-judgemental administator. I have in this attempt failed. Instead for
]the last six years, I have played babysitter to misbehaved children. I
]wish that this percentage of players was realitively small, after looking
]closely I find that Ive dealt with a large portion of the players, and
]of those players often I have to deal with the same individuals who I see
]repeated a circle of abuse. I simply have no longer an interest in 
]running Dragonheart at this time and its current form. Someday I "may" do
