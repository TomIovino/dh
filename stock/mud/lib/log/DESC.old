regard you carefully as a smile plays upon her lips.  She wears a simple green

On the palm of her right hand is a small white scar.

assist you see an average citizen stumble upon him drunkly, you see two bright
flashes
The forsaken citizen who was at the wrong place at the wrong time writhes in
agony

This well-aged kid walking down the street has a glare on his face
When you see an average drunk stumble upon him you go about your business
But then, there are two bright flashes and the drunk writhes in agony
Upon your notice, you see the average nyx or fyrtunge sword
But you could have sworn, his swords were not of this world

Nof, the weak. Nof, the fallen. Nof, the betrayer. He has brought shame to many
that had none before. He attacked in an orgy of rage and madness, and seemed
more focused on the sheer joy of battle then the simple fact of killing. May
his suffering equal his betrayal.

The proper buisness of the warrior is death.  His only concern must be to
destroy the enemy, or else die fighting.  In the face of the enemy, our
objective is to destroy him utterly, and there must be no hesitation or lack of
resolve in this regard.  If brute force doesn't solve the problem, you're not
using enough.

This bitter but loveable vampire was once member of the mighty Clarios clan
With many of his fellow clanmembers's ashes strewn in the sea he roams about
the worl 
He gathers his bearings and finds that he is always at a decent spot.
His weapons, average. But His knowledge, grand. 


derek--Thu May 16 17:29:02 2002
His Armor is etched with the many runic mottos of Clarios Clan.
His icy glare is perpetual, but his mood is never on edge.
In battle, his weapons are not of this world, but they seem average otherwise.
He may present himself as passive and small, but in battle his shadow is grand 
He Is not Immortal, but he is by no means of this world.

This young, thiny child is crysing loudly for his mom.
His eyes scortched in fear, scared to face the evil world.
Not even the whole luck in the world will help him survive till his next
birthday ...

The remainders of what was once House Hellstorm
Has been put into the soul of a young warrior
The fallen regent, All thats left
He will have his revenge.
