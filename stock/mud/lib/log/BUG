Marah (d/castle/diesirae/i)(Sun Dec 16 01:29:35 2001):
explorer - i cast it, and nothing happens.. a couple of times i got the 'You have no heart beat!' message, and then it left me 'focus and quick cast' -ing forever without ending.. if i try to cast another spell, it doesnt work, i keep focus and quickcasting.. and then if i cast explorer again it stops the loop, BUT starts it all over again.

Ozzy (w/jada/water/water1)(Sun Jan 27 11:58:28 2002):
dunno if this is a bug but its a problem, if u cast while invis u go vis, but if u hit invis, u can stay invis??? sup with that

I'm not completely sure...  but in the room I'm in...  Air Elemental Guardian (usually), there hasn't been a guardian all night.  I haven't seen it rift...  but it seems strange, because elementals have been empty cept me...  and this mob won't pop.

Matthew (w/vhorilen/plains/pln35)(Sat Mar  9 21:40:51 2002):
i cast storm and it said my skill in spell increased

Ozzy (d/castle/deathscythe/i)(Mon Mar 11 13:43:16 2002):
whenever i stat, every spell is successful except agility which fails about 2 times, it's way too much of a coincidence cause it happens every time i stat (probably about 500 times by now)

when you type hide after your hidden, instead of saying, you step out, it just says you hide again

Sakura (w/ash/shadow/fi_e)(Wed May 22 16:01:50 2002):
every time I try to strike a ruby golem, it tells me i begin to sneak up and never goes through. it works on all of the other golems fine, so that's a bit strange.

track is buggy, i type track, and it doesnt even give me any results, nothing happens, this happens about 50% of the time

Lachdanan (w/shaidar/licit/ce4)(Tue May 28 13:03:27 2002):
hmm, one thing i notice that i think needs to get fixed/changed is that whenever you are fighting someone, and you run away, you're in the other room and you are still in combat w/ enemy condition showing, and you can get your exit blocked from the block skill of the person/npc that is not in the room, combat should end the instant you successfully run away

Lefend (d/castle/adredus/i)(Wed May 29 22:39:52 2002):
With Privacy Seal, when you cast it. You can purify it and the effects of the privacy still remain leacing you free to cast barrier seals and such
