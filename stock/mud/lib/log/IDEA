Nilgo (d/inn/nilgo)(Mon Apr  9 01:45:49 2001):

Lefend (d/town/church/church)(Tue Apr 17 21:10:14 2001):
Do you think it might be possible to code in a 1 minute warning for 1 vs 1 arenas?

Acydreign (d/town/church/wchurch)(Thu Apr 19 02:32:13 2001):
New Skill => balance or equal (something like that)  equals out mana and hp...  ie: if you had 400 hp and 600 mana... you'd have 500 mana and 500 hp

since we can only cast one psychic rune at a time and it does wear off after awhile can we get the psychic rune time to show on our affects list or have a message that appears to us saying something like your rune fades to dust

Grendell (d/inn/grendell)(Wed Apr 25 19:58:19 2001):

i got this idea from a game, have a spell you cast and the next spell you cast after that will affect everyone in the room, but you gotta do it every time to make it do it to everyone, make it cost like 100+ mana too..

Solatarius (d/castle/alderon/b)(Tue Jul 17 01:09:09 2001):

What if the "spells" command listed wis spells on left and int spells on right, then sorted proficiency/alpha? Would be nice. Then I could just look at my spell list to see what spells I have that are wis based, etc.

Inan (w/trent/dwarf/d03)(Wed Aug 15 06:24:51 2001):
That whole ally thing? Make it so if someone tries to ally you with their house you have to accept. That can get people killed when someone lists you as an ally and you actually couldn't give a damn about them / their house / their side of the realm.

Nilgo (d/castle/diesirae/i)(Mon Aug 20 12:22:20 2001):

we also need dislodge... to remove people's shields in combat... that would help a lot

Drakmorr (d/world/o/12)(Fri Aug 24 00:20:15 2001):
i think there should be a charm spell or a golem/elemental spell. i know we already have an avenger spell but i think it would add a little bit to the game to have some animal or creature following. have the spells like before the better the skill the better animal or the better the elemental/golem. just an idea. thanks drakmorr.

Right now arenas suck.  Every big peep is afraid to do an arena because of cripple.  Is there anyway to make it so cripple is not allowed in arena?  Lately I havent seen an arena that was worth watching.  Its always just a few of one side. Also I think everyone would like if if one night a week there was a Grand Arena.  Something with a higher prize.  Ive seen people with literally 20 potions in their rips.  For most of the big peeps its not even worth it.  Just my 2 cents.

Lina (d/castle/auragamii/i)(Sun Apr 28 12:11:12 2002):
have the dragon weapons give different stats, no one uses them now, i was thinking +3 casting/stealth/offense/defense, each one on a different dragon weapon, if they had those kinds of stats maybe people would use them more

Tskrang (d/town/church/church)(Sat May 18 15:43:31 2002):
how about making an exclusive skill for defensive tactics, like flank. that could either reduce all damage levels or perhaps raise attack levels... becase you're taking combat slower and more controled and can either predict their blows or get a good angle on the hits you do have.

Moltar (d/castle/diesirae/b)(Sat May 18 22:06:57 2002):

i think we should have a new spell...called 'Confusion'...and what this spell could do it is confuse the person who casted it on the opponent and confuse them making them hit any1 near them......

Dalandow (d/town/church/donation)(Sun May 19 15:01:34 2002):
the fairy wings should make you have wings, then they would be really cool

Moltar (d/castle/diesirae/b)(Tue May 21 22:00:14 2002):
there should be grandstands so u can watch the arena

Posideon (d/castle/deathscythe/b)(Tue May 21 22:00:30 2002):
arena should log each person what they did so everyone else can see what happend after it is over.

Moltar (d/castle/diesirae/i)(Tue May 21 22:02:28 2002):
there should be a shield that blocks lances but u can only use a crappy weapon with it or something

Nebacanezer (w/vhorilen/plains/pln44)(Tue May 21 22:02:36 2002):
a type of grandstand for arena for players to watch the ongoing arena battle

Nechochwyn (d/castle/deathscythe/i)(Thu May 23 18:55:52 2002):
i think we should have another no pk weekend

Lachdanan (d/castle/adredus/i)(Sat May 25 08:01:53 2002):
Make 4 new dragons, one more to each keep on the south side of keeps, 2 pieces give +3 casting (was thinking ring and floating), and 2 pieces give +3 stealth (cloak and greaves would be cool), and they form together to make a dragon shield, stormweaver, it could have the same stats as robe, and maybe a bonus to shield crush as a special

Tskrang (d/town/church/church)(Sat May 25 15:54:51 2002):
how about some elite spells for people with high int/wis.... int could get something like attune, that essentially lowers the armour class of the person they are trying to hit and wis could get some sort of nature's ally thing that summons differnt animals to help them fight kind of like the old elementals only their strength or type of animal depends on how well it's notched.

Solatarius (d/town/church/church)(Sat May 25 19:28:36 2002):
invis should damage hp like walking around in arena does... its too powerful as is and would curb its use alot more

Arein (d/town/church/church)(Tue May 28 07:50:48 2002):
Warpoints- If you have 4 less warpoints than someone you kill, you should get a bonus WP.  Go from 1 to 3 or something.  For killing a skilled pk'r.  The minimum would be 5WP on the killed, so they'd have to have PK skill to get to 5.  And then put in an ACTUAL code for when you kill someone with 4 less than you, you lose a WP.  That way people stop killing level 51 and stuff...

Arein (w/vhorilen/plains/pln19)(Wed May 29 05:16:14 2002):
remove the EMOTE kneel, because its a command

Matthew (d/town/church/church)(Thu May 30 13:19:10 2002):
top

Matthew (d/town/church/church)(Thu May 30 13:19:22 2002):
why are people like stilgar on the toplist if they aren't playing?

Lachdanan (d/castle/adredus/b)(Fri May 31 10:34:19 2002):
Offensive and Defensive tactics should get a casting penalty, it should be hard to cast cure and heal and things like that in the middle of a fight in offensive, because you for sure cant hit or tank in casting at all

Lachdanan (d/arena/main)(Sat Jun  1 11:46:42 2002):
feedback still does nothing, needs to do a lot more damage for the mana/affect time it has, it did Zero to all the pepole i've tested

Lachdanan (d/castle/adredus/i)(Sat Jun  1 11:56:59 2002):
make a Duck skill for primal, it needs some defensive skill properties

Lachdanan (d/castle/adredus/i)(Sat Jun  1 21:05:22 2002):
make Hide have the same properties as Invis, so that you cant' use emotes in channels to people who are hiding, and cant attack them by typing kill person in the room...

Arein (w/jada/water/water1)(Sun Jun  2 22:25:41 2002):
bring back a spell similar to summon elemental... it added fun to the game

Arein (w/jada/water/water3)(Sun Jun  2 22:25:57 2002):
with the new spell though, make different kinds of elems (or whatever) have special hits...

Lachdanan (d/castle/adredus/i)(Sun Jun  2 23:23:35 2002):
make barbarian/amazon titles the Profession titles instead, that way you can have your own title if you're not in a house...

Aeacus (d/castle/nelgetha/b)(Mon Jun  3 22:46:40 2002):
there should be a new channel for newbies...  that people that are under level 10 can use too.... Maybe NH could even have the power to silence newbies on it incase of spam. and I think NH should be appointed by ash and leela.  Just an Idea   Aeacus

Lachdanan (d/castle/adredus/i)(Sun Jun  9 12:22:20 2002):
there REALLY needs to be a way to get rid of Deflect, maybe with cancel..but, deflect has become quite problematic, at least for what i can see..there needs to be a way to take it off

Lachdanan (d/castle/adredus/i)(Sun Jun  9 13:09:49 2002):
make Magic seal an affect on a person instead of a room effect, it would be equal to Slow w/ it's anti-flurry

Nechochwyn (d/castle/deathscythe/i)(Wed Jun 19 12:33:20 2002):
there should be a place on ashs website that shows the top players automatically updated every day or so

Arein (w/lohk/port/pal/m25)(Sun Jun 23 05:05:28 2002):
snarl emote... hehehehe... i think that sounds so cool

Arein (w/ash/base/desert/1c)(Sun Jun 23 05:20:39 2002):
dragonkin spell, bring that back, it was pimpy

Azrhei (w/lohk/port/pal/m25)(Sun Jun 23 21:01:37 2002):
it would be cool if you could give gear to castle mobs and have them wear/wield the best 'level' of gear they had, ie, divine then godly...automatically.  you'd be able to better defend your castle and you would lose the gear to a boot or to someone invading.  just a thought.

Arein (d/world/y/13)(Mon Jun 24 06:51:33 2002):
BRING BACK DRAGONKIN spell.. it saved so much time, heh
