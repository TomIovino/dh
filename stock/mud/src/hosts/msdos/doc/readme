     -=[ Ms-dos LPmud 3.2.1@xx Driver ]=-

Using John Olson's msdos47.zip source package, I was able to
hack a port for the amylaar3.2@286 driver.  I have been
waiting for someone else to do it, but it appeared that noone
was willing to do it.  I wanted the Amylaar driver as stable
platform for my mudlib (Heaven7) to run on ms-dos, so creator's
could develop home.  It is not pretty as I am not a wizard at C.
There is a compiled version of a compat-mode amylaar driver in
the file, HVN7_DOS.ZIP.  If you want another configuration you
will have to compile it yourself (It is compiled with
COMPAT_MODE and INITIALIZATION_BY___INIT).

I compiled it with DJ Delories port (DJGPP) of GCC 2.5.7 with
maintenances to 5, BYACC19.zip, and NDMAKE45.zip - I still
can't get the GNU MAKE to work.  These are all available on
any simtel-20 archive site.  The home ftp site for simtel-20
is 'oak.oakland.edu'.  For those in Australia try
'archie.oz.au', /micros/pc.

I merged the changed in the general 3.2.1 distribution, but
changed them again to make it fit better in the rest of the code,
and left out some parts I deemed unnecessary.
I couldn't test it. If it doesn't work as is, plaese point it out
to me what is not working.

README of LPmud for MS-DOS         4-NOV-1991, 20-JULY-1994, 1-Aug-1994
==========================

Overview
--------

Amylaar3.2@286 for MS-DOS is a version of LPmud which has been
modified to run on 386/486-based MS-DOS machines. It has been
compiled with DJ Delorie's excellent port of GNU C++. Sessions
on up to ten virtual consoles and both "standard" serial lines
are supported.


Restrictions
------------

File names have to obey MS-DOS naming conventions.

Text files which contain CRs aren't processed correctly. CRLFs
are okay. 

Old style object files which contain the character RS (30dec) aren't
processed correctly. (This is to work around the CR bug.)

Virtual consoles run synchronously to the game. This means
that long computations (e.g. compilation of a larger object)
will cause noticable delays in input processing.

There is no network support, sorry.
Look at Linux, NetBSD or FreeBSD if you want some.



Documentation files
-------------------

  README       (this file) describes how to set up an LPmud on
               MS-DOS using HVN7_DOS.ZIP

  BUILDING     describes how to set up the source to compile LPmud 3.2.1@xx


Requirements
------------

LPmud for MS-DOS *requires* a 386SX, 386DX, 486SX, 487SX or
486 CPU. Anything less than a 386 won't do - don't bother
trying.

Memory shouldn't be critical because LPmud can page to disk
(and the game driver implements swapping of unused objects as
well), but performance will drop considerably if LPmud has to
page excessively.

You should have about 5-10 MB of free disk space for LPmud
binaries and support files, at least 1 MB for page/swap files
(more if your MUDLIB is large) and as much space as you need
for your MUDLIB.


Installation
------------

CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT should be stripped down as much as
possible. Especially memory managers, RAM disks, disk caches,
FPU emulators and other programs which use special 386/486
features should be avoided. (QEMM and VDISK should work, but
this hasn't been tested.) It's a good idea to main- tain two
sets of config/autoexec files: one with all your TSRs for
normal operation and one which gives the 'raw' machine to
LPmud.

The only programs that really should go into AUTOEXEC.BAT are
DOS' file sharing support SHARE.EXE, the serial communication
drivers (see below) and possibly keyboard and disk drivers.

(The emulator isn't necessary if a co-processor is available
but this hasn't been tested.)

LPmud files should go to the following directories (on C:): 
 \LPMUD        LINES, AM32_SRC.ZIP (Source Patches)
 \LPMUD\BIN    AMYLAAR.EXE, EMU387, COMDRV.COM, MUD.BAT
 \LPMUD\DOC    all documentation files
 \LPMUD\MUDLIB Heaven7 Mudlib

Add the directory C:\lpmud\bin to your path in autoexec.bat.

To unpack the binary distribution, just create a directory
\LPMUD, CD to it, get PKUNZIP and type,
     PKUNZIP -d HVN7_DOS \lpmud

Create a directory C:\TMP. The page file of the virtual memory
system will go there.

If you plan to support connections over serial lines, you have
to load a communications driver for each port. The following
command loads a driver for COM2 with local line editing (79
characters buffer) enabled: 
    \LPMUD\BIN\COMDRV -C2 -E79

In addition to that, \LPMUD\LINES has to be edited to reflect
the configuration, e.g.:

    # line bps carrier
    1     2400 y
    2    38400 n

\LPMUD\LINES has to be present and the environment variable
SERIAL has to point to it even if no serial lines support is
desired. Lines can be commented out by prefixing them with a
'#'.


MUDLIB
------

The heaven7 mudlib comes with the package, it uses MS-DOS naming
conventions for 95% of lib. The file xnames is a script for
unix to convert the msdos names to unix.

  - the following names aren't valid base names for
directories and files:     AUX COM1 COM2 COM3 COM4 CON LPT1
LPT2 LPT3 LPT4 NUL PRN   - names must not contain more than
one dot (e.g. monster.shout.c)   - names must not start with a
dot (e.g. .foorc)

While those restrictions rarely affect directory names and
files which are created by the MUDLIB, they usually cause
problems with a large number of the files which constitute the
MUDLIB. Their names and all references to them have to be
changed to transform a UNIX MUDLIB to an MS-DOS MUDLIB. 

Files which contain CRs without LFs aren't read correctly. To
work around the most common occurence of isolated CRs, NLs in
objects save files were dumped as RS' (0x1e) in previous ports.
This old format can still be read.
Unfortunately, this breaks old style object save files
copied from a unix system which contain RS characters.

You need to have a least one wizard character in order to be
able to shoot the game down smoothly once you're brought it
up. Because encrypted passwords are different between LPmuds
on MS-DOS and UNIX, you have to edit a player file (e.g.
\lpmud\mudlib\usr\creators\admin.o) manually and delete the
password line.

It is highly recommended that you change the password
immediately after bringing up the game if you plan to allow
outside access to the game ! 


Running LPmud
-------------

BEFORE you start LPmud, make sure 
        - you've loaded SHARE.EXE, if you want to allow logins from 
        the serial lines - the communication driver(s) 
        - have \lpmud\bin in your autoexec.bat path. 
        - edit mud.bat if your default drive is not c:\

To run type 'mud' to run mud.bat

After a few seconds, LPmud will begin to pre-compile a few
objects and a virtual console will pop up. Hit [Enter] to
connect to the game driver. (It takes a few seconds until
LPmud shows the login prompt.)

The following keys are interpreted by the console driver:

     F1 ... F10   switch to the respective console
     Alt-H        ("hangup") disconnects the currently active     
         
                  console
     Alt-S        suspends LPmud and spawns a DOS shell.          
          
                  EXIT returns to LPmud.

The game is shut down with the  'shutdown'  command which can
be issued by any wizard.

The  people  command shows the connection type in the "IP
address": 
    0.0.0.100 to 0.0.0.109  are virtual consoles
    0.0.0.110 to 0.0.0.113  are COM1 ... COM4
