This is a brief description of how to install LPmud 3.2 on a unix host:

Make a directory 'mud', which contains a dir named 'src', 'bin' and 'lib'.
Move the game driver source (this code) to the src directory.

cd to src. execute ./configure . This will check for a number of site
specific settings, and can take about a minute or two.
For NeXT-Step 2.1, supply --with-target=NeXT .

Edit the Makefile, defining where the lib and bin is. Check definitions
in config.h, most are probably good as they are. The ones that are
important wrt. which mudlibs can be run are COMPAT_MODE NATIVE_MODE
OLD_PREVIOUS_OBJECT_BEHAVIOUR OLD_EXPLODE_BEHAVIOUR INITIALIZATION_BY___INIT
You get the most 2.4.5 compatibility if you define all of these but
NATIVE_MODE . Likewise, you get the most 3.0 compatibility when you define
all but COMPAT_MODE. The most interesting configuration is probably not
to set any of these.

Do 'make install' and 'make install.utils'.

Get a mudlib. One way to do this is to get the source to 2.4.5, which includes
a mudlib in the directory 'mudlib'. Copy all those files into your 'lib'
directory.  To make file access from within the game work properly, you
have to apply 2.4.5-player.c-diff from src/mudlib to lib/obj/player.c .

Copy the file src/mudlib/master.c to lib/obj/master.c (in COMPAT_MODE),
otherwise to lib/secure/master.c. Copy the file src/mudlib/simul_efun.c
to where it is supposed to be. That is defined by the function
get_simul_efun in master.c.

Test the game with 'driver &'.

If you see the message 'Setting up ipc', then you are up and running.
Test with 'telnet localhost 7680' ; that is, when you change the port
number in config.h , the changed number does apply.
