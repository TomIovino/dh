Source code copyright 1995 by Brian Gerst (Garion@Timewarp).
Based on the standard erq demon for LPmud 3.2.1 by Joern Rennecke.

Source code herein refers to the source code, and any executables
created from the same source code.

******************************

This is a replacement for the erq demon that comes standard with the
Amylaar 3.2.1 driver.  It differs from the standard erq in that it 
doesn't make use of subservers, which can cause zombie processes.

You need gcc or another ansi compatible compiler.

I know that it works under linux, and at least compiles under sunos, but
I don't have access to any other platform to test.

This directory should be moved into the driver source directory.

Any bug/questions/comments, mail to bgerst@quark.gmi.edu.
